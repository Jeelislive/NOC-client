 ## Getting Started
 
 ### Prerequisites
 - Node.js >= 18
 - npm, pnpm, or yarn
 
 ### Installation
 ```bash
 # Using npm
 npm install
 
 # Using pnpm
 pnpm install
 
 # Using yarn
 yarn
 ```
 
 ### Local Development
 
 ```bash
 # start dev server
 npm run dev
 # or
 pnpm dev
 # or
 yarn dev
 ```
 
 The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.
 
 ### Build for Production
 
 ```bash
 npm run build
 npm run preview   # optional: serve the production build locally
 ```
 
 ---
 
 ## Environment Variables
 
 Create a `.env` file at the project root. Example:
 
 ```bash
 VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
 VITE_SENTRY_DSN=
 VITE_FEATURE_FLAG_X=false
 ```
 
 - For Vite, variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.
 - Never commit secrets. Use `.env.local` for machine-specific overrides (gitignored).
 
 ---
 
 ## Scripts
 
 Update these to match your package.json:
 
 ```bash
 # Dev and build
 npm run dev         # start development server (Vite)
 npm run build       # build for production
 npm run preview     # preview production build (Vite)
 
 # Quality
 npm run lint        # run ESLint
 npm run lint:fix    # fix lint issues
 npm run format      # run Prettier
 npm run test        # unit tests
 npm run test:watch  # watch mode
 ```

 ## Project Structure
 
 Example structure—adjust to your app:
 
 ```
 frontend/
 ├─ public/               # static assets
 ├─ src/
 │  ├─ app/               # app shell, providers
 │  ├─ components/        # shared UI components
 │  ├─ features/          # feature-based modules
 │  ├─ pages/             # route views
 │  ├─ routes/            # route definitions
 │  ├─ hooks/             # reusable hooks
 │  ├─ lib/               # utils, API clients
 │  ├─ store/             # global state
 │  ├─ styles/            # global styles / tailwind.css
 │  ├─ assets/            # images, icons
 │  ├─ main.tsx           # app entry

 ## Code Style
 
 - ESLint and Prettier are configured to ensure consistent code style.
 - Recommended VS Code extensions:
   - ESLint
   - Prettier
   - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (if applicable)
 
 Optional pre-commit hook (Husky + lint-staged):
 - Formats staged files and runs quick lint/tests before committing.

 ## Testing
 
 - Unit tests with Vitest and React Testing Library.
 - Example:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:watch
   ```
 - Add tests for new components, hooks, and utilities.
 - Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100% for its own sake.

 ## Performance and Accessibility
 
 - Use React.lazy and dynamic imports for code-splitting heavy routes.
 - Preload critical assets where appropriate.
 - Follow WAI-ARIA best practices; verify with:
   - Lighthouse
   - axe DevTools
 
 ---
 
 ## Deployment
 
 Common options:
 - Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages
 
 Basic flow:
 1. Build: `npm run build`
 2. Deploy the `dist/` directory.
 
 Set environment variables in your hosting provider.

 ## FAQ
 
 - Q: Where do I configure API base URL?
   - A: In `.env` using the `VITE_` prefix.
 - Q: How do I add a new route?
   - A: Add a component in `src/pages/` and register it in `src/routes/`.
